Hi, welcome to the Happy Transcriber Repo!

This is a simple app that will convert audio files into text transcription. It supports transcribing multiple files at a time, and runs off OpenAI's state-of-the-art transcription AI Whisper.

Feel free to download it here for Windows:
 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dvSNLSBYPNQvQPzkzvv_K8Qn_xteNioW/view?usp=drive_link

Double click the link, and it will install the app. 
Search the app and open it.
Upon first run, it will ask for your OpenAI API key. Search YouTube to figure out how to get this. You will need to pay OpenAI $5 to start using the service. (which is good for ~15 hours of transcription!)


If you want to build it yourself, feel free, but it's a bit hacked together. If anyone really wants to build it, create an issue and I will improve the documentation, thanks!
